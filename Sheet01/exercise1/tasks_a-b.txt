paging
-> program used to view (but not modify) the contents of a text file moving 
   down the file one line or one screen at a time. 
   Some, but not all, pagers allow movement up a file (for example less)
pager is a symlink to less, so default pager -s could be written as less -s
Man pages first check if pager is available, else cat is used

Found by reading man man and search "pager linux" in Wikipedia/Stackoverflow

To jump directly to a specific section:
man --pager='less -p ^ENVIRONMENT' less
